# Building a Student Intervention System
Project 2 of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. 
The goal of the project was to build a classifier using Python that could help a 
school district predict graduaPon rates for students. Preprocessed feature columns 
using NumPy and Pandas. Trained and evaluated three models (Support Vector Machine, 
Naive Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbors) and used an F1 metric to determine the best model. 
Used GridSearchCV to tune the parameters of the Support Vector Machine Classifier.


## Getting Started
Project instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/jason-osajima/building_a_student_intervention_system/blob/master/project_instructions.md),
which has information on the dataset used for the project. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jason-osajima/building_a_student_intervention_system/blob/master/student-data.csv). 
My solution for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/jason-osajima/building_a_student_intervention_system/blob/master/student_intervention.ipynb).
