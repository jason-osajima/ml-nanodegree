Engineer Nanodegree. Project 3 of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. The goal of the project 
was to use an unsupervised classifier to identify clusters of customers for a wholesale distributor. 
Reviewed unstructured data and analyzed correlations between different spending categories. Analyzed spending 
patterns of customers using boxplots and scatter plots. Reviewed unstructured data and analyzed correlations between 
different spending categories. Analyzed spending patterns of customers using boxplots and scatter plots.Preprocessed data
using feature scaling and removed outliers. Analyzed the variance explained by principal components and used dimensionality 
reduction to reduce data into 2 components. Trained a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with two clusters, based on the silhouette 
scores of several cluster examples. Made predictions about the natural categories of multiple types in a dataset, then checked 
these predictions against the result of unsupervised analysis.
