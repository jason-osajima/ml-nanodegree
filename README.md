# capstone_project
Project 5 of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

## Abstract
This project is the Capstone Project for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program.
I developed a convolutional neural network to classify satellite images based on six land cover categories.
The dataset I used can be downloaded here [http://csc.lsu.edu/~saikat/deepsat/].

## Requirements
This project runs on Python 2.7, along with the following packages:
* numpy (version 1.10.4)
* pandas (version 0.18.0)
* tensorflow (version r0.1)
* h5py (version 2.6.0)
* matplotlib (version 1.3.1)
* scipy (version 0.18.0)

## Acknowledgements
A huge thank you to Saikat Basu et al. for producing an amazing dataset of satellite images 
and Vincent Vanhoucke et al. for constructing a fantastic deep learning course at Udacity
which made difficult, cutting edge concepts simple to understand.
