# Predicting Boston Housing Prices
Project 1 of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. 
Used NumPy to investigate various metrics of the dataset. Built a decision tree regressor using Python, evaluated it 
using a mean absolute error metric, and tuned its parameters using GridSearchCV. Interpreted learning 
curves for regressors using different parameter settings. Learned how to differentiate between high variance and high bias cases.


## Getting Started
